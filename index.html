<h2>CS 230 - Introduction to Computer Systems - Fall 2019</h2>

<p>
<b>Lecture</b>:  TR 11am-12:15pm; Bush 212</br>
<b>Web</b>: <a
		  href="https://rollins-cms.github.io/cms230-fall19">https://rollins-cms.github.io/cms230-fall19</a> Check the calendar page frequently.<br>
<b>Instructor:</b> Dr. Valerie Summet (vsummet [at] rollins.edu)<br>
<b>Office Hours</b> (in Bush 218D): 
<ul>
<li>T, R:  2-4pm</li>
<li>W: 10-11am</li>
<li>and by appointment (just email me to schedule)</li></ul></p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
<b>From the catalog:</b> Introduction to the study of how software controls the critical
hardware components of a computer's architecture, the CPU and
RAM. Topics include development of C language programs, comparison of
high-order procedural languages to machine language programs, CPU
organization and functionality at the register/bus level, instruction
formats, and development of machine language and assembly level
programs using multiple addressing modes, flow-of-control branching
and subroutine calls. Prerequisites: CMS 170. 
</p>

<p><b>A better description:</b>  Computer science is about so much more than programming!  In this class, we really get to get under the hood and see how a computer really works.  There's a beauty to the hardware level and really understanding how a machine can run the code you write.  This requires understanding bits and bytes, how a program can be translated from a high-level language into something the computer can understand, and how both data and instructions are stored and accessed from memory.
</p>


<h3>Course Materials</h3>
Philosophy: I try very hard to keep course materials costs reasonable.  I'm very sympathetic to the high costs of textbooks with endless "new" editions.  I utilize free resources when I can.  The total cost for materials for this course is under $100 and the hardware is yours to keep.
<ul>

<li>Required Textbook: None!  All the readings for this class are freely available and links will be posted on the class website.</li>
<li>Development Tools:
<ul>
<li> We use GitHub for assignment submissions.  Github is free.  You'll receive instructions for how to sign-up for an account (if you don't already have one) on the first day of class.
<li> We use <a href="http://www.mimirhq.com">Mimir</a> for Linux and C development. The cost of this platform is $25 for the semester. Sign-up for a student account.  You will then be able to join this course.  The access code for this course is: 4ec18d4bf3  Mimir has a <a href="https://help.mimir.io/en/articles/1200979-how-to-pay-for-mimir-classroom-access"> helpful page </a> which shows you how to pay for the course after your free trial has ended. </li>
</ul>

<li>Hardware Platform: You must buy the Raspberry Pi and its necessary
peripherals. See the <a href="./resources/pi-guide.pdf">shopping guide</a> for more information on what you
need to purchase. The Raspberry Pi is yours to keep and use in
future projects.</li>

</ul>

I will maintain your grades on Canvas using the above category weightings so that you may track your progress.  Should you find a grade recorded incorrectly, please bring it to my
attention immediately.
<br><br>
The homework assignments are significant programming projects using C,
assembly language, and the Raspberry Pi. There will be approximately
six homework assignments (every two or three weeks, depending on
difficulty) and they will all be equally weighted in the calculation
of your final grade. <b>Start the homework early</b>. Don't wait until the last minute.
<br><br>
The midterm will cover material from the first half of the class. The
final is cumulative, but 
will be weighted towards material covered since the midterm. See the <it>Important Dates</it> section below for the dates of these exams this semester.  DO NOT MISS THESE! The final exam 
will not be rescheduled except in emergency cases with documentation provided. Leaving early for the holidays is never an emergency.
<br><br>
Disputes of grading on assignments,
exams, etc must be discussed within one week of their
return or posting. While I will quickly correct small, bookkeeping
errors, you may be asked to submit a written argument justifying why
your work deserves a higher score.

<h3>Course Policies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Attendance: The only way to be consistently successful in
your academic career is to regularly attend class meetings and
participate in class activities.  Therefore, while I do not mandate
attendance at every single class, I expect full attendance every time
we meet. When you miss a lecture, you are
responsible for catching up with the material.  Most in-class activities cannot
be made up if you are absent.  Should you need to miss clas for religious activities, you must notify me by email of the dates and times of these absences by the end of the drop/add period.</li>

<li>Laptops:  If you have a laptop, please bring it to class so we
can use it for in-class programming activities.  Laptops are permitted
for in-class programming activities only.</li>

<li>Phones:  Unlike laptops, I see few advantages to using phones
during class.  Please silence your phones at the beginning of class.
Holding text conversations during class is both distracting and
disrespectful. </li>

<li>Late Submissions: Assignments are due on the stated day at the
stated time.  Assignments submitted by the next class period will
incur a penalty of 10%.
Any work not submitted by the next class period will receive a 0. For
example, if an assignment is due "By the start of class on Tuesday",
you would have until the start of class on Thursday to turn the
assignment in for the late penalty.  After class on Thursday, you
would not be permitted to submit your assignment.</li>

<li>Please speak to me if there are any issues making it difficult
  for you to succeed in class.  We can always work out a plan to deal
with illness, work, or family responsibilities. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Necessary and Proper Clause</h3>
As the instructor, I will make every effort to adhere to the
topics and schedule described in this syllabus.  However, I reserve
the right to make changes for the good of the course. 

<h3>Honor Code</h3>
Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an
obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all
things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor -
honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility - particularly
manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part
of the admission process to the College, students agree to commit
themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation
process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to
uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their
activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student
signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the
student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College:  
 
<blockquote>
The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to
a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College
community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show
my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating,
or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly,
respectfully and honorably in my social life and in my relationships
with others. This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits
work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the
paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement:<br><br>

 <b>"On my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed
   any unauthorized assistance on this work."</b>
</blockquote>

Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge;
submission implies signing the pledge. <br><br>

 <b>How do I interpret the Honor Code?</b><br>
 In the context of this class, my interpretation of the Honor Code
 pledge is that the work you submit for every assignment shall be
 <b>your own original creation</b>.  This means that any item you
 submit must be written by you and you alone, or in an assigned group
 project by your group alone.  Copying a solution from fellow class
 members, previous class members, books, or the Internet is a
 violation of this policy and will constitute academic misconduct.   
 <br><br>
  <b>What is acceptable collaboration?</b><br> 
  It is acceptable to talk about problems and solutions with other
  members of the class in general terms.  If you're talking about how
  you might solve a problem, or discussing how to use features of
  C, that is generally allowed.  Copying or sharing code, even if
  you change the code in small ways, is definitely not permitted.  
  <br><br>
  It is acceptable to consult books and Internet resources like
  Stack Overflow for general programming questions---I consider this to
  be documentation---but it is not acceptable to copy entire solutions
  from other sources.
  <br><br>
  <b>How do I document my collaboration?</b><br>
  You must thoroughly document any other
  students or outside materials you consult in the course of
  completing an assignment.  For example, if you consult Stack
  Overflow, you should copy and paste that URL into the README.md file in your
  GitHub repo for that assignment.  If you consult with another student, you should
  include their name as well.  There is <b>no penalty</b> for
  appropriate collaboration, and documenting other students and/or
  sources consulted will not impact your grade on the assignment.
  <br><br>

  <b>Please ask if you have questions about what is
  permissible!</b>

<h3>Accessibility Services</h3>
Rollins College is committed to equal access and inclusion for all students, faculty and staff.  The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 create a foundation of legal obligations to provide an accessible educational environment that does not discriminate against persons with disabilities. It is the spirit of these laws that guides the college toward expanding access in all courses and programs, utilizing innovative instructional design, and identifying and removing barriers whenever possible. <br><br>
 
If you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of academic accommodations in order to fully participate in your classes, please contact the Office of Accessibility Services, located on the first floor of the Olin Library, as soon as possible. You are encouraged to schedule a Welcome Meeting by filling out the “First Time Users” form on the <a href="https://www.rollins.edu/accessibility-services">accessibility services website</a> and/or reach out by phone or email: 407-975-6463 or Access@Rollins.edu.<br><br>

All test-taking accommodations requested for this course must first be approved through the Office of Accessibility Services (OAS) and scheduled online through Accommodate at least 72 hours before the exam. Official accommodation letters must be received by and discussed with the faculty in advance.  There will be no exceptions given unless previously approved by the OAS with documentation of the emergency situation. We highly recommend making all testing accommodations at the beginning of the semester. OAS staff are available to assist with this process.

<h3>Credit Hour Statement</h3>

Rollins College offers four-credit-hour courses that provide three
(50-minute) hours of direct or indirect instructional contact. The
value of four credit hours reflects the substantial individual
attention each student receives from instructors as well as additional
out-of-class activities. Faculty require that students undertake at
least 7.5 (60-minute) hours of outside work per week, averaged over
the course's duration and equaling two and one-half (2.5) 60-minute
hours of outside work for every one (50 minute) hour of scheduled
class time. In this course, the additional outside-of-class
expectations are substantial programming projects, technical reading,
and written assignments utilizing the computer systems concepts
presented in class. 


<h3>Recording Device Use</h3>
In order to protect the integrity of the classroom experience, the use of recording devices is limited to either the expressed permission of the faculty member or with proper documentation from the Office of Accessibility Services.  Information about accommodations through Accessibility Services can be found at http://www.rollins.edu/accessibility-services/. Recording without the proper authorization is considered a violation of the Rollins Code of Community Standards.


<h3>Title IX Statement</h3>

Rollins College is committed to making its campus a safe place for students. If you tell any of your faculty about sexual misconduct involving members of the campus community, your professors are required to report this information to the Title IX Coordinator. Your faculty member can help connect you with the Title IX Coordinator, (TitleIX@rollins.edu or 407.691.1773). You will be provided with information, resources and support. If you would prefer to speak to someone on campus confidentially, please call the Wellness Center at 407.628.6340. They are not required to report any information you share with the Title IX Coordinator. <br><br>

Misconduct under Title IX includes gender-based discrimination and harassment, sexual harassment, sexual violence including fondling and assault, sexual coercion/force, sexual-based communication, sexual exploitation, interpersonal violence including dating and domestic violence, stalking, complicity and retaliation. Everyone is protected under the following protected statuses: sex (including pregnancy), gender, gender identity (including transgender status), gender expression, and sexual orientation. For information, visit https://www.rollins.edu/sexual-misconduct/.<br><br>


<h3>How to Hack My Class</h3>
At the start of every semester, someone always asks, "How can I be successful in CMS230?"  Last year, I asked the current CMS230 students to share their advice with you.  Here are their top five pieces of advice:
<ul>
  <li>Start homework early!  (19/23 students)</li>
  <li>Take and review (good, well-organized notes) every day</li>
  <li>Attend office hours</li>
  <li>Communicate with the professor; ask for help; be proactive</li>
  <li>Apply yourself; work hard</li>
</ul>

Other bits of wisdom they would like to share with you:
<ul>
<li>Coming to class is important!</li>
<li>Practice with smaller problems before starting the HW</li>
<li>Don't get behind!</li>
<li>Pointers are hard.  Spend lots of time working on them</li>
<li>Always push your code to GitHub</li>
<li>Don't try to memorize -- understand!</li>
<li>Go slow.  Read everything thoroughly</li>
<li>Leave lots of time for this class</li>
<li>Do the labs even if they're not graded.  They help with HW</li>
<li>Ask questions.  It won't magically make sense one day</li>
</ul>
